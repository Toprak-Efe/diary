## CLI Diary (C++23)

- Create daily logs via nvim, stored locally in SQLite. C++23 and nvim required.
- You can install with `mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && sudo make install`.
- If you want to, you can link SQLite dynamically by changing entering CMakeLists.txt and changing 'STATIC' to 'SHARED'.
